# Acrylamid Themes

A work in progress for a collection of themes to use with Acrylamid.

## Quickstart

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:posativ/themes.git /path/to/blog
$ cd /path/to/blog
$ vi conf.py  # and choose THEME
$ acrylamid compile
```

You can set THEME to anything inside `ls theme/`.

## Contribute

Just add a new folder to `theme/` and put all your theme assets and templates
in there.

Samples of the current themes can be viewed live at http://posativ.github.io/themes/
while the code repository which drives them is at https://github.com/posativ/themes/tree/gh-pages
